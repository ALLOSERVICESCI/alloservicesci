        comment: "❌ MARQUEE DOUBLE-BUFFER RE-TEST AFTER FIXES (iPhone 12/13/14: 390x844) - PARTIAL SUCCESS: ✅ MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS: 1) Fixed critical 'marqueeX.stopAnimation is not a function' error by replacing with cancelAnimation, 2) Home page now loads correctly with French slogan 'Tous les services essentiels en un clic', 3) Marquee structure fully visible with orange 'Infos' pill (#FF8A00 background), 4) Fallback content present and visible ('Agression . ACCIDENT . DISPARITION . Embouteillage'), 5) No console errors or useNativeDriver warnings for marquee, 6) Added missing marqueeRow style to fix rendering. ❌ REMAINING ISSUE: Animation not active - no translateX transforms detected during measurement, suggesting React Native Reanimated animation may not be running properly in React Native Web environment. 🔍 ROOT CAUSE: React Native Reanimated double-buffer animation implementation may not be compatible with React Native Web, causing animation to not start despite proper setup. CONCLUSION: Marquee structure and content working perfectly, but smooth scrolling animation needs alternative implementation for web compatibility."

Comprehensive E2E test (iPhone 12/13/14: 390x844) reveals red screen errors in both index.tsx (splash) and home.tsx (main page). Console shows: 'ReferenceError: RNAnimated is not defined' and 'ReferenceError: Animated is not defined'. App cannot start properly due to animation import issues. PARTIAL FIX APPLIED: Fixed home.tsx (Animated -> RNAnimated) but index.tsx still failing. This is blocking all Home page functionality including FAB 'Publier', info capsule scrolling text, and auto-redirect after publishing.
