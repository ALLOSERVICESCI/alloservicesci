The AI engineer successfully progressed the Allô Services CI application through multiple iterations, primarily focusing on UI/UX, localization, and functional enhancements. The initial phase addressed a critical language persistence bug on the Profile page, ensuring French as the default while respecting user choices. Subsequent work included extensive localization of various screens (Profile, Notifications, Payments History), dynamic header adjustments with logo and title changes, and the crucial implementation of a responsive city selector with search on the Modifier mon profil page, alongside profile photo upload and contact detail editing. Language support was expanded to include Turkish and Chinese while removing Arabic. Payment flow via CinetPay was robustly integrated, with platform-specific URL handling and comprehensive error management. The splash screen navigation was refined. Most recently, the Pharmacies page received significant functional upgrades, adding dynamic filtering for on-duty pharmacies, location-based search (Autour de moi), and a city dropdown, requiring both frontend and backend modifications. Throughout, automated frontend testing was heavily utilized, prompting continuous refinements for UI element visibility and logical flow.

<product_requirements>
The Allô Services CI mobile application is a multi-service platform for Côte d’Ivoire and its diaspora, available in French, English, Spanish, Italian, Turkish, and Chinese. It offers free access to essential services (e.g., emergencies, pharmacies) and a premium subscription (1200 FCFA/year) for features like geo-localized alerts with image uploads, integrated with CinetPay. The app features category carousels (Urgence, Santé, Éducation) with dynamic header visuals and a user profile for managing personal data. The technology stack includes Expo for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and MongoDB. Core functionalities cover user registration, payment processing, push notifications, and AI assistant. Recent efforts have focused on enhancing UI/UX for a native-feeling, thumb-friendly experience, including an animated splash screen, refined category headers, robust navigation (hamburger menu), and a feature-rich Allô IA chat. The primary objective is a polished, user-centric mobile application.

<code_architecture>
The application employs a full-stack architecture with Expo for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and MongoDB for data storage.



-   : Main FastAPI backend. Enhanced to support filtering for pharmacies, including  (pharmacies de garde), , and location-based (, , ).
-   : Initial navigation layout. Modified to hide tab bars.  component was made globally available but its visibility later restricted to the Home page. Fixed notifications initialization for Expo Go.
-   : Home screen. Updated language selector (FR, EN, ES, IT, TR, ZH). Removed the list of languages previously displayed under the user's name.
-   : Dedicated Pharmacies screen. Now features a dynamic header with a locally stored image (), responsive height, and an overlay. Implemented UI for Pharmacies de garde toggle, Autour de moi (location-based) toggle, and a city dropdown with search. Integrated with the backend API to fetch filtered pharmacies.
-    (also referred to as ): Premium subscription page. Displays Paiement sécurisé par CinetPay (now consistently translated and visible). Alertes and Pharmacies links now correctly point to their respective main category pages ( and ). Payment initiation link () is re-established with platform-specific opening logic ( for web,  for mobile) and authentication checks.
-   : Profile screen. Fixed language persistence bug (defaulting to English). Displays user avatar if available, replacing the Allô Services CI logo. Devenir Premium label correctly translated to French.
-   : Profile editing screen. Added fields for modifying phone number, email, and uploading a profile picture. Features a left-aligned, alphabetically sorted city dropdown with a search bar. User's profile photo displays in a circle, replacing the logo.
-   : Notifications center. Displays logos above Allô Services CI and Centre de notifications titles. Text defaults to French. Navigation bar removed.
-   : Payment history. Displays logos above Allô Services CI and Historique des paiements titles. Text defaults to French. Navigation bar removed.
-   : Splash screen. Modified to prevent blocking in test environments by adding a short timeout and touch to continue functionality.
-   : Hamburger menu. Initially contained Home, Alerts, Pharmacies, Premium, Profile. Modified to only include Profile and Premium icons. The language selector within the header (right side) was updated to reflect new language additions (TR, ZH) and the removal of AR.
-   : Manages user authentication state. Extended  type with an  field.  handles avatar persistence. Initialisation of remote notifications is now conditional to avoid issues in Expo Go Android SDK 53.
-   : Internationalization configuration. Languages updated: Arabic (AR) removed, Turkish (TR) and Chinese (ZH) added. Added translations for new labels (e.g., , ). Implemented strict language validation and fallback to French () to prevent crashes from invalid stored language settings.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Pharmacies Page Refinements:** User validation required for Autour de moi default radius (currently 5 km), confirmation of filter labels, and decision on adding a visual indicator (badge) when a filter is active.
-   **EAS Build Preparation:** Configuration steps for an Android EAS build (type of build, Android package ID, deep link scheme for CinetPay, branding confirmation) are pending user input.

<current_work>
The most recent work focused on significantly enhancing the Pharmacies page. The AI engineer implemented several new filtering capabilities based on user requirements: a toggle for Pharmacies de garde (on-duty pharmacies), a Autour de moi (around me) slider which, when active, uses the user's location to display nearby on-duty pharmacies (defaulting to a 5 km radius), and a city dropdown for filtering when the Autour de moi feature is off. If no filters are active, all pharmacies are displayed. This required modifications on both the frontend () for the UI controls and logic, and the backend () to extend the  endpoint to support , , and geo-location (, , ) query parameters. The header of the Pharmacies page was also adjusted to include a local, responsive image with an overlay and the Pharmacies title positioned bottom-left. The AI engineer is currently awaiting user validation of these new features and related parameters (e.g., default radius, label confirmation).
