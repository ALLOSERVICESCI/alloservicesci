The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Allô Services CI application from inception to a feature-rich state, with a strong focus on French language standardization and user experience. Initial work involved a significant revamp of the Pharmacies page, adding dynamic search and interactive filters, alongside backend enhancements for  calculations. A comprehensive linguistic overhaul ensured consistent French texts across the application, from slogans and category labels to premium features.

Major feature additions included a dynamic, multi-language animated marquee on the Home screen, a robust category content system populated with real-world Côte d'Ivoire data, and the re-establishment of the Allô IA feature with quick prompts, recent prompts, and premium access gating. Pull-to-refresh functionality was also integrated across key pages.

Persistent challenges included an ongoing issue with smooth animation rendering for the marquee on React Native Web, despite multiple  and double-buffer implementation attempts. Furthermore, a critical bug emerged with the Publier button on the Home screen, repeatedly failing to display despite various positioning and visibility fixes. The engineer demonstrated iterative problem-solving, but these two UI-related bugs remain central.

<product_requirements>
The Allô Services CI application is a multi-service platform for Côte d’Ivoire, aiming for a native user experience. It supports multiple languages (FR, EN, ES, IT, TR, ZH), offering free essential services and a premium subscription (1200 FCFA/year) for geo-localized alerts with image uploads and CinetPay integration. Key features include dynamic category carousels, user profiles, registration, push notifications, and an AI assistant.

Recent development focused on:
1.  **Pharmacies Page:** Enhancements with autocompleting city search, dynamic headers (Pharmacies • [City]), and interactive filter badges (Autour de moi, De Garde) with haptic feedback and tooltips.
2.  **French Localization (Core):** Standardizing all default UI texts to French, including slogans, category labels (e.g., removing cat_ prefixes), premium feature descriptions, and button texts across Home, Premium, Notifications, and Profile.
3.  **UI Enhancements:**
    *   Splash screen with multi-language animated Bienvenue and slogan, cycling through all supported languages before redirecting.
    *   Alerts Page: Removing the Alerts title, renaming the Publier une alerte button to Publiez (positioned mid-left), displaying published alerts in French, adding a clickable Lu badge (green if read, grey if unread, removes alert on click), showing attached images (downloadable), and including publication date/time. Alerts expire and auto-delete after 24 hours.
    *   Créer votre compte Page: Displaying the Allô Services CI logo, title, and subtitle, removing language selectors, and setting legal consent text in French.
    *   Home Page Marquee: A scrolling summary of notifications/alerts, styled as a rounded capsule between Bonjour... and categories, with larger font, an Infos button linking to the Alerts page. Content includes full publication titles separated by a dot, with titles colored by relevance (Danger/Disparition/Accident in red, Alerte/Embouteillage/Inondation in orange). It fetches real-time publications from the API.
    *   Pull-to-refresh: Implemented on Home, Pharmacies, and Notifications pages.
    *   Allô IA Feature: Re-enabled via a menu entry, with default French texts, UI improvements (safe areas, keyboard), quick prompts, and recent prompt history (local storage).
    *   Premium Gating for Allô IA: Allô IA is inactive/greyed for basic users, with an alert to Devenir Premium on tap.
    *   Home Page Publier Button: A button on the Home page that redirects to Publier une alerte.
    *   Post-Publication Experience: Redirection to Home with an Alerte publiée snack message after an alert is successfully published.

<code_architecture>
The application utilizes a full-stack architecture with an Expo frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.



-   : The main FastAPI backend, enhanced to dynamically calculate  status for pharmacies, enabling accurate filtering.
-   : The splash screen/entry point. Modified to implement a multi-language animated Bienvenue and slogan cycle before navigating to the home screen.
-   : This file is extensively modified. It now contains the dynamic, auto-refreshing marquee displaying alert summaries, an Infos button linking to the Alerts page, pull-to-refresh functionality, a floating Publier button (which has seen multiple positioning attempts and is currently inline with the emblem), and a snack message for Alerte publiée after successful publication. Significant animation logic using  has been integrated here.
-   : Modified to remove the header title, reposition the Publiez button, implement a clickable Lu badge (which now removes the alert), display publication date/time, show attached images as thumbnails, and filter out alerts older than 24 hours. It also supports pull-to-refresh.
-   : The Publier une alerte page. Modified to streamline the form (removing the flood field), change the button text to Publier, and integrate local notification addition and redirection to the home page upon successful alert submission.
-   : Enhanced with city search, dynamic headers, interactive filter badges, and pull-to-refresh functionality.
-   : Modified to remove the Réinitialiser les infobulles action tile from the actions grid.
-   : This screen's city selection mechanism now utilizes the centralized list of cities from .
-   : Updated to display the Allô Services CI logo, title, and Créer votre compte subtitle, while removing inline language selectors and ensuring legal consent text is in French.
-   : Modified to remove cat_ prefixes from category labels and to integrate the rich, real-world content from .

<current_work>
The most immediate prior work focused on resolving the persistent issue of the Publier button not appearing on the Home screen. Initially, the button was configured as a floating action button (FAB) positioned at the bottom-right. When the user reported it wasn't visible, attempts were made to ensure correct JSX injection, import , and enforce visibility using high  and , adjusting its  position and moving the Allô IA FAB to prevent overlap.

Despite these efforts, the user continued to report the button's absence. The latest approach, in response to the user's specific request positionne le bouton, publier en bas à droite à côté du logo embleme (position the publish button bottom right next to the emblem logo), was to change the button's implementation from a floating FAB to an inline element. This involves integrating the Publier button directly into the Home screen's emblem section, within the same  layout as the emblem, aligned to the right, ensuring it's always rendered and has a distinct orange style, rounded borders, and a megaphone icon. This aims to explicitly place it in the DOM structure rather than relying solely on absolute positioning. The user has not yet provided feedback on the visibility of the button in this new inline configuration.
