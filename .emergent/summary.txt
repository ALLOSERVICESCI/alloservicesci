The AI engineer successfully developed the Allô Services CI mobile app, establishing a robust FastAPI backend with MongoDB and an Expo/React Native frontend. Initial work focused on core features like user authentication, premium subscriptions via CinetPay, and basic screen layouts. A major phase involved resolving critical build issues (EAS, API URLs) and implementing internationalization for five languages.

Subsequent efforts heavily focused on iterative UI/UX refinements for the Premium and Profile pages, including detailed payment history and notification management. A significant challenge arose with the mobile preview displaying a blank screen due to  conflicts and persistent  CSS errors in React Native Web. The engineer meticulously debugged and resolved these, rolling back problematic styles and cleaning caches, ultimately ensuring the app's functionality on native mobile platforms. The most recent work involved extensive redesign of the Home and Profile pages to match the sophisticated Premium page aesthetic, with a focus on icon updates, text sizing, and carousel placement, iteratively addressing user feedback.

<product_requirements>
The Allô Services CI mobile application serves as a public utility for Côte d’Ivoire and its diaspora, supporting five languages (FR, EN, ES, IT, AR). It provides free access to essential services (emergencies, pharmacies) and offers an annual premium subscription (1200 FCFA) for advanced features, integrating CinetPay for payments (Orange Money, Wave Money, bank cards). Users can publish alerts with images and share information. Key categories (Urgence, Santé, Éducation) require carousel display and dedicated pages with header images. User profiles manage photo, name, email, phone, and Ivorian city location. The home page offers personalized greetings. The backend uses FastAPI with MongoDB for user, category, alert, and payment data, while the frontend is Expo, utilizing Expo Router for tab-based navigation. Core functionalities like user registration, live CinetPay payment, push notifications, and basic alert creation are implemented and branded.

<current_work>
The Allô Services CI application is in a highly refined state. The backend is fully operational, including user management, category data with premium gating, CinetPay payment, and segmented push notifications. Frontend development has extensively focused on UI/UX enhancements and critical bug fixes.

Recent work included:
1.  **Premium Content Verification:** Backend endpoints for premium content (e.g., categories, exams) were re-implemented and tested to correctly return 402 for non-premium users, achieving 100% pass rate.
2.  **EAS Update (OTA) Configuration:**  and  were configured for Over-The-Air updates, and a  script with an accompanying  was created to facilitate this.
3.  **UI/UX Redesign - Premium Page:** The Premium page () underwent several iterations. It now features a large app logo (190px total diameter) with an elegant green outer and white inner border, a subtle shadow, and a concise Premium 1200 FCFA / an title displayed on a single line. A grid of premium features with clear descriptions and adaptive call-to-action buttons (Create Account, Subscribe, Renew) is implemented.
4.  **UI/UX Redesign - Profile Page:** The Profile page () was updated to align with the sophisticated design of the Premium page, featuring a refined avatar section, elegant user information cards, and a clear action grid.
5.  **UI/UX Redesign - Home Page:** The Home page () was significantly transformed. It now includes the identical large logo (130x130px) with green/white border and shadow. The main title Allô Services CI (32px), slogan (18px), and personalized greeting (20px) are prominently displayed. The category carousel now uses larger emoji icons (48px) instead of PNG images, with distinct aesthetic styling for premium categories (golden background/border, larger premium badges). The Bienvenue welcome text was removed, and Accédez à tous les services exclusifs was centered. The carousel was then re-positioned to the middle of the screen for one-hand use, and the Accédez à tous les services exclusifs container was moved below it.
6.  **Critical Bug Fix (Mobile Preview):** The app faced persistent  preventing mobile preview. This was thoroughly debugged and resolved by fixing  subdomain conflicts, clearing Metro cache, and specifically replacing problematic / React Native styles with  for web compatibility. The issue was traced to and fixed in , , and , ensuring the application now functions correctly on mobile preview and native devices.
