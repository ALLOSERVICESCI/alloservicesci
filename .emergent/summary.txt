The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Allô Services CI mobile application from inception to a stable, feature-rich state. The project began with backend setup using FastAPI and MongoDB, defining extensive data models, and implementing core APIs including user authentication, premium subscriptions, and live CinetPay payment integration. Frontend development leveraged Expo Router for navigation, incorporated user-provided assets, and established key screens for Home, Alerts, Pharmacies, Premium, and Profile.

A significant portion of the trajectory focused on resolving critical build and runtime issues, such as EAS keystore problems, JavaScript bundling errors (fixed by adding ), and persistent API URL inconsistencies in EAS builds, which were resolved by correctly injecting  in  and fortifying the API utility. Backend Not Found errors for  and  were diagnosed and fixed by re-exposing routes.

Subsequent work, guided by iterative user feedback, expanded upon core functionalities:
1.  **Internationalization (i18n):** Implemented 5-language support (FR/EN/ES/IT/AR) with a global provider, dynamic language switching in Profile settings, and language selection during user registration. RTL support for Arabic was included.
2.  **Pharmacies Endpoint:** The  endpoint was re-activated and backend-validated.
3.  **User Profile & Notifications:** User profile editing (language, city) was enabled with backend PATCH support. A local notifications center was created to store push history, and notification segmentation by language/city/premium status was implemented at the backend.
4.  **Premium Experience:** The Premium page UI was significantly enhanced with the app logo, dynamic Renew/Become Premium button, display of subscription expiry, and a post-payment alert for status refresh. A comprehensive Payment History screen was added with client/server-side filtering for accepted payments and options to open/share CinetPay transaction links.
5.  **UI/UX Refinements:** Numerous visual adjustments were made to the Premium and Profile pages, including logo sizing, text alignment, spacing, and the removal/addition of visual separators, all iteratively tuned for a polished look. A startup crash related to font loading was also fixed by preloading Ionicons.

<product_requirements>
The Allô Services CI mobile application aims to be a public utility for Côte d’Ivoire and its diaspora, supporting five languages: French, English, Spanish, Italian, and Arabic. It offers free access to essential services (emergencies, pharmacies) and an annual premium subscription (1200 FCFA) for advanced features, integrating Orange Money, Wave Money, and bank cards via CinetPay. Users can publish alerts with images and share information.

Core categories include Urgence, Santé, Éducation, and others, requiring a carousel display and dedicated pages with header images. User profiles necessitate photo, name, email, phone, and location (Ivorian cities). The home page greets users by name. The backend is FastAPI with MongoDB, managing user, category, alert, and payment data. Frontend is Expo, using Expo Router for navigation, with a tab-based layout. Key features like user registration, CinetPay payment (live), push notifications, and basic alert creation are functional, with app branding and personalized greetings harmonized across the UI.

<current_work>
The Allô Services CI application has achieved a robust state. The backend, built with FastAPI and MongoDB, supports all core functionalities: user management, category data, alerts, CinetPay payment (live), and push notifications with segmentation. The frontend, developed with Expo, features a comprehensive Expo Router navigation structure with tab-based layouts.

Recent efforts focused heavily on enhancing user experience and fixing critical issues:
1.  **Internationalization (i18n):** Full 5-language support (FR/EN/ES/IT/AR) has been integrated, affecting tab titles, key screens (Home, Alerts, Pharmacies, Premium, Register, Profile), and error messages. Language selection is available during registration and via profile edit, with French as default and RTL support for Arabic.
2.  **Pharmacies Endpoint:** The  backend endpoint has been re-activated and validated, with the frontend defaulting to a 5km radius.
3.  **User Profile & Notifications:** A profile editing screen allows users to update their preferred language and city, synchronizing with the backend. A new Notifications Center screen was implemented to store a local history of received push notifications, accessible from the profile. Backend notifications now support segmentation by city, language, and premium status.
4.  **Premium Features:** The Premium page UI was refined with the app's logo, dynamic Renew/Become Premium button, display of subscription expiration, and an Actualiser le statut (Refresh Status) alert post-payment. A Payment History screen was added, offering a detailed list of transactions with client/server-side filtering for accepted payments and options to open/share CinetPay transaction links.
5.  **UI/UX Polishing:** Extensive iterative adjustments were made to the Premium and Profile pages, focusing on logo sizing (increased to 180x180 with a white circle background, green border, and light shadow), text alignment (centering all content on profile), and spacing for a polished visual appearance. A startup error related to font loading (6000ms timeout) was resolved by preloading Ionicons.
The application is in a state where core user flows, including registration, CinetPay payments, push notifications, and profile management, are functional with multi-language support and enhanced UI.
