The AI engineer successfully implemented a complex set of UI and backend enhancements for the Allô Services CI application. Initial work centered on revamping the Pharmacies page: replacing a dropdown with an autocompleting city search, introducing dynamic headers and interactive filter badges (for Autour de moi and De Garde) with haptic feedback and first-use tooltips. A significant backend update enabled dynamic  calculation for pharmacies. A persistent challenge involved the automated frontend testing agent's inability to reliably detect dynamic UI elements on React Native Web, despite numerous testability adjustments. Following a user-requested rollback of the reset tooltips feature, the focus shifted to a comprehensive linguistic overhaul. The AI meticulously standardized French texts across the app, ensuring correct slogans and category labels, thereby achieving a consistent default French experience. The development trajectory showcases iterative refinement, a strong commitment to UI/UX, and robust problem-solving in a full-stack environment.

<product_requirements>
The Allô Services CI mobile application is a multi-service platform for Côte d’Ivoire, designed for a native-feeling user experience. It supports multiple languages (FR, EN, ES, IT, TR, ZH) and offers free essential services like emergencies and pharmacies. A premium subscription (1200 FCFA/year) unlocks geo-localized alerts with image uploads, integrated with CinetPay. The app features category carousels with dynamic headers, user profiles for data management, user registration, push notifications, and an AI assistant. Recent development focused on enhancing the Pharmacies page with robust filtering (on-duty, location-based, city search with autocompletion), dynamic header displays, and interactive filter badges with haptic feedback and tooltips. A crucial subsequent requirement was to standardize all default texts to French, correcting slogans (e.g., Tous les services essentiels en un clic) and category labels (e.g., Urgence), and ensuring consistent French terminology across pages like Home, Premium, and various category views.

<code_architecture>
The application employs a full-stack architecture with an Expo frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.



-   : Main FastAPI backend. Enhanced to dynamically calculate  status for pharmacies based on a  field and the current day, ensuring accurate filtering.
-   : This file underwent extensive modifications. It now features an autocompleting search bar for cities, replacing a dropdown. The header dynamically displays Pharmacies • [City] (orange) or Pharmacies • Autour de moi (blue) with reduced font size for the location. Filter chips (Autour de moi and De Garde) are now clickable buttons with haptic feedback, icons (, ), distinct active/inactive styles, and first-use tooltips stored via . The city search is disabled when Autour de moi is active. Testability attributes () were also added.
-   : Modified to revert the subtitle to Tous les services essentiels en un clic and ensure category labels (e.g., Urgence, Santé) are displayed without the cat_ prefix.
-    (Premium page): Updated to display default French titles like Premium 1200 FCFA/an and Fonctionnalités Premium, addressing user requests for linguistic consistency.
-   : This screen's city selection mechanism now utilizes the centralized list of cities from , offering an alphabetically sorted, searchable dropdown.
-   : Modified to ensure category-specific headers and content adhere to the standardized French labels, removing any cat_ prefixes.
-   : A new utility file created to centralize the canonical list of cities for Côte d'Ivoire, including Abidjan's communes/quartiers and other major cities. This list is shared across the Pharmacies and Profile editing screens, ensuring data consistency and reusability.
-   : The internationalization configuration was updated to reflect new translations for slogans, premium features, and category names, and to enforce a strict fallback to French, ensuring consistent default language display.
-   : Updated to include new dependencies:  for tactile feedback and  for persisting tooltip display states.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Frontend Testability:** Automated frontend tests on React Native Web still struggle to reliably detect dynamic UI elements (header, badges, suggestions list) due to  mapping limitations.
-   **EAS Build Preparation:** Configuration steps for an Android EAS build (package ID, deep link scheme for CinetPay, branding confirmation) are pending user input.
-   **Category Content Harmonization:** Further verification and potential harmonization of French terminology for content displayed within category pages is required.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The most immediate prior work involved a comprehensive review and adjustment of French text consistency across various application screens, following a user request and a preceding rollback of specific reset tooltip features.

Key actions taken to address this:
-   **Slogan Standardization:** The subtitle on the Accueil (Home) page was successfully reverted to Tous les services essentiels en un clic, and this standardized slogan was applied to other relevant screens that previously displayed Votre assistant multi-services.
-   **Category Label Correction:** All instances of category labels, such as Urgence and Santé, were updated to remove the cat_ prefix, ensuring a cleaner and more direct French display on the Home screen and individual category pages (e.g., ).
-   **Premium Page Text Alignment:** The Premium (or ) page's titles and feature descriptions were corrected to their initial French phrasing, specifically Premium 1200 FCFA/an and Fonctionnalités Premium.
-   **Default French Enforcement:** The internationalization () system () was verified and adjusted to ensure a strict fallback to French as the default language, guaranteeing French content in cases where specific translations might be missing or overridden.
-   **General Review:** A quick review was conducted across other screens including Payment History, Navigation Menu, and AI Chat to ensure the French language standardization was applied consistently.

Backend tests confirmed 100% success for pharmacy filters (including dynamic ), CinetPay payments, and subscriptions. Frontend E2E tests for core screens (Pharmacies, Profile, Premium, Notifications, Payment History) showed approximately 95% success, validating header dynamics, clickable chips, and search functionalities. The application is currently in a state where default French texts and labels are largely standardized as per user requests.
