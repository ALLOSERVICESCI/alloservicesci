The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the Allô Services CI mobile application development. The work progressed through several phases, starting with clarifying the technology stack from Firebase to FastAPI + MongoDB, based on platform capabilities. A significant portion of the effort was dedicated to setting up the backend with detailed data models for various categories, implementing core APIs including user authentication, premium subscriptions, and CinetPay payment integration (initially stubbed, then live with provided credentials).

On the frontend, the engineer established the Expo Router navigation, integrated user-provided images (icons and headers), applied a custom color palette, and implemented key screens like Home (with category carousel), Alerts (with image upload and push notification broadcast), Pharmacies (with geolocation), and Premium. Crucially, extensive debugging and iterative fixes were performed to resolve build issues (EAS keystore errors, JavaScript bundling failures), navigation problems (redirects), API URL inconsistencies in EAS builds, and backend Not Found errors for core routes. The recent breakthrough of successful user inscription and CinetPay payment flow validates a major part of the application's core functionality. Push notifications are also integrated, pending full testing in a development build. The next immediate focus is on internationalization (i18n) and building out the user profile section.

<product_requirements>
The user requested Allô Services CI, a public utility mobile application for Côte d’Ivoire and the diaspora, for Android and iOS. It must support five languages: French, English, Spanish, Italian, and Arabic. Basic access (emergencies, pharmacies) is free, while other features require an annual premium subscription (1200 FCFA) via Orange Money, Wave Money, and bank cards. The application needs a database (initially requested Firebase, confirmed to be MongoDB). Users can publish announcements/alerts with images and share information via WhatsApp/Facebook.

Key categories include: Urgence, Santé, Éducation, Examens & Concours, Services publics, Emplois, Alerte, Services utiles, Agriculture, Loisirs & Tourisme, and Transport. Display requirements include category icons in a carousel, and a dedicated page for each category with a header image. The application needs user profiles with photo, name, email, phone, and selectable location (Ivorian cities/communes). The home page should greet the user by name (e.g., Bonjour Mr Jean). A payment page for CinetPay integration is required.

**Implementation Done So Far:**
- Backend: FastAPI + MongoDB. All categories have detailed data models, indexes, and seeded example data. CRUD APIs are implemented for most categories, including user management, subscriptions, alerts (with base64 images), useful numbers, pharmacies (geolocation), jobs, and CinetPay payment initiation/validation (live).
- Frontend: Expo Router for navigation, tab-based layout (Home, Alerts, Pharmacies, Premium, Profile), integrated user-provided icons/headers, applied Ivorian flag-inspired color palette, implemented basic user registration/authentication, user profile screen placeholder, alert creation with image upload, and CinetPay payment flow (opens payment page externally).
- Push Notifications: Integrated using Expo Notifications, with backend endpoints for token registration and sending alerts.
- App Name: Allô Services CI is harmonized across  and main UI screens, along with the slogan Tous les services essentiels en un clic and personalized greeting Bonjour Mr {Prénom}.

<current_work>
The Allô Services CI application has made significant progress and reached a stable state for core functionalities. The backend is robustly set up with FastAPI and MongoDB, handling comprehensive data models for all categories, user management, and subscriptions. Crucially, the CinetPay payment gateway is now live and fully integrated with the provided credentials, managing payment initiation and webhook-based subscription activation. Push notifications are implemented, allowing alerts to be broadcast to registered devices.

On the frontend (Expo), the application features a well-structured navigation system using Expo Router, including tab-based navigation for primary sections (Home, Alerts, Pharmacies, Premium, Profile). User-provided image assets (icons and headers) are integrated, and a consistent color palette inspired by the Ivorian flag has been applied across the UI. User inscription and authentication flow are functional, with user details stored and push notification tokens linked to user IDs. The ability to create new alerts, including image uploads (base64), is operational, triggering automatic push notifications.

Recent work focused heavily on resolving critical build and runtime issues encountered during EAS development builds on Android:
-   **Keystore Generation:** Fixed the 500 Internal Server Error during keystore generation by guiding the user to generate it locally and upload it manually.
-   **Bundle JavaScript Error:** Resolved build failures related to Unknown error in the Bundle JavaScript build phase by adding the missing  dependency.
-   **Navigation and Redirection:** Addressed issues where inscription buttons (from Profile and Premium tabs) were not redirecting. Programmatic navigation () has been enforced to ensure reliable redirects.
-   **CinetPay Payment Opening:** Fixed the problem where the CinetPay payment page was not opening. This was primarily due to the  environment variable not being correctly configured in the EAS development build. The  file was updated to inject this variable, and the frontend API utility () was made more robust with a fallback URL and explicit error alerts for failed API calls.
-   **Backend Not Found Errors:** Diagnosed and rectified  errors for critical backend routes like  and . These routes were explicitly re-exposed in , and a  endpoint was added for backend status checks.

As a result, both **user inscription and the CinetPay payment flow are now confirmed to be working correctly** on Android development builds. The application name Allô Services CI, slogan Tous les services essentiels en un clic, and personalized greeting Bonjour Mr {Prénom} are also harmonized throughout the UI. The current state allows for user registration, triggering push notifications by creating alerts, and initiating premium payments.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to start implementing i18n for 5 languages and re-activating/validating the Pharmacies () endpoint.
